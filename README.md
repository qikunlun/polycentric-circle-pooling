# Polycentric Circle Pooling in Deep Convolutional Network for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Recognition
We presents a simple but effective method for handling rotation variance problem in CNNs for HRSI classification. This issue is important in HRSI recognition for the context of deep network. We propose a solution to train a deep network with a polycentric circle pooling layer. PCP-net can conveniently apply the pretrained CNNs and be end-to-end training, which is important for deep network successfully used in HRSI recognition. The experimental results show that our proposed PCP-net can boost the accuracy in HRSI classification and detection tasks.
